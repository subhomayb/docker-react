We will configure travis-ci to test our codes. To do that we will use Dockerfile.dev as we will only test development phase. Once done then we will deploy the prod. 
The steps will be:
1. We will tell travis that we need a copy of docker running
2. Build our image using Dockerfile.dev
3. Tell travis how to run our test suite.
